# fake-news-detection-using-ml
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based system to classify news articles as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to demonstrate text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation in a real-world classification problem.
The project follows an end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data cleaning, text normalization, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, and performance comparison across multiple algorithms.
